## System Architecture

The system is built using a modular design comprising:

- **Frontend** (HTML/CSS/JS with Jinja2 templates)
- **Backend** (Python Flask)
- **Machine Learning Model** (ML Libraries in Python)
- **Firestore Database** (User profiles and prediction history)
- **Firebase Authentication** (Login, Registration, Password Reset)

### Prediction Flow

1. Users access a questionnaire to input medical data.
2. Backend validates and sends data to the ML model.
3. ML model returns:
   - Diabetes status: Diabetic, Prediabetic, Non-diabetic, Stress-induced Diabetic, or Stress-induced Prediabetic
   - Hypertension status
   - BMI status
4. Results are shown on the frontend and optionally saved if user is logged in.
